# Text-To-Speech-App
This is a Python script that creates a GUI using the tkinter library for a Text-to-Speech (TTS) application. 
The application allows users to input text and convert it into speech using the pyttsx3 library. The GUI includes a text area for inputting text, two drop-down menus for selecting the voice and speed of the speech, and two buttons for speaking and saving the speech as an audio file.

The speak() function gets the text entered in the text area, the selected voice and speed, and uses the pyttsx3 library to generate the speech. The download() function is similar to speak(), but it saves the speech as an audio file in the selected directory.

The GUI is divided into two frames: the top frame contains a logo and the application title, while the main frame contains the text area, drop-down menus, and buttons. The GUI also includes some icons for the buttons and the application icon.

Overall, this script provides a simple and easy-to-use TTS application with a user-friendly GUI.
